**Interview Pitch**

**Project Overview:**

I developed a robust, fully functional API that supports complete CRUD operations—allowing clients to create, read, update, and delete records. The API also includes advanced search features, enabling users to filter data by title, category, rating, and date ranges.

**Key Contributions:**

- **Layered Architecture:**
  - **Entity Layer:** Designed core data entities with appropriate JPA annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`, ensuring a clear mapping to the database.
  - **Repository Layer:** Leveraged Spring Data JPA by extending `JpaRepository`, implementing both built-in CRUD methods and custom queries using `@Query`.
  - **Service Layer:** Encapsulated business logic and data access in service classes, using `@Transactional` to ensure proper transaction management.
  - **Controller Layer:** Created RESTful endpoints using `@RestController`, efficiently managing HTTP requests and responses.

- **Validation & Exception Handling:**
  - Applied input validation using annotations like `@NotBlank`, `@Min`, and `@Max` to guarantee data integrity.
  - Developed custom exceptions and a global exception handler (`@ControllerAdvice`) to provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

- **Configuration & Deployment:**
  - Configured an H2 in-memory database for development and testing, which can seamlessly transition to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments.
  - Utilized Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency injection to simplify setup and ensure scalability.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Wrote unit and integration tests to validate the API’s functionality and reliability.
  - Documented API endpoints with detailed usage guidelines to ensure smooth integration with client applications.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Java OOP & Design Patterns:** Strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Applied these principles throughout the project to ensure clean, modular code.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Proficient in working with key data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps to optimize performance and solve complex problems. I used these data structures to implement efficient logic in various parts of the application.
- **Spring Framework:** Proficient with Spring Boot annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, and experienced in structuring applications with `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@RestController`.
- **Database Management:** Expertise in Spring Data JPA, JPQL, and custom native SQL queries for efficient database interactions.
- **RESTful API Design:** Followed best practices to create intuitive, standards-compliant endpoints.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Configured CORS to handle requests from multiple origins effectively.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented pagination and explored caching strategies to enhance performance.

**Outcome & Learnings:**

This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of building scalable, maintainable web services. I also deepened my expertise in:

- **Application Architecture:** Designing modular, clean architectures that maintain a strong separation of concerns.
- **Java OOP & Data Structures:** Applying OOP concepts and leveraging data structures to create efficient, well-structured code.
- **Spring Ecosystem:** Maximizing Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA's capabilities to accelerate development.
- **Problem-Solving:** Navigating challenges in data validation, exception handling, and transaction management.

**Why This Experience is Valuable:**

The skills I've acquired are directly applicable to the work your team is doing. My hands-on experience with Spring Boot, Java OOP, and data structures, along with a focus on performance and scalability, positions me to contribute effectively from day one. I’m eager to apply my expertise to collaborate with your team on impactful projects.
